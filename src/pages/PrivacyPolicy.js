          <h2>6. Retention Of Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We retain Your Information, including Personal information, only as
            long as We need it for purposes as laid out in Section 3 and as
            permitted by applicable law. If You decide to stop using Our
            Service, You can close your account, and Your profile will stop
            being visible to other members. Note that We will close Your account
            automatically if You are inactive for a period of one year. After
            Your account is closed, We will delete your personal information, as
            laid out below:
          </p>
          <p>
            (a) To protect the safety and security of Our members, We implement
            a safety retention window of three months following Account closure
            or one year following an Account suspension. During this period, we
            keep your information in the event that it might be necessary to
            investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of
            information during this safety retention window is based on Our
            legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party
            victims.
          </p>
          <p>
            (b) Once the safety retention window elapses, We delete Your data
            and only keep limited information for specified purposes, as laid
            out below:
          </p>
          <ul className="custom-list">
            <li>
              We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention
              obligations as required, in particular to comply with tax and
              accounting legal requirements, credit card information for the
              duration the user may challenge the transaction, and “traffic
              data” / logs to comply with legal data retention obligations. We
              also keep records of consents members give Us for five years to
              evidence Our compliance with applicable law.
            </li>
            <li>
              We maintain limited information on the basis of our legitimate
              interest to support Our customer care decisions, enforce Our
              rights, and enable Us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim,
              information on the existence of past accounts and subscriptions to
              ensure proper and accurate financial forecasting and reporting,
              profile data in anticipation of potential litigation, for the
              establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, and data
              necessary to prevent members whose accounts were suspended or
              terminated for violation of Terms from opening a new account, for
              as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of
              Our members.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, We maintain information on the basis of Our legitimate
              interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim,
              or dispute requiring Us to keep information (in particular if We
              receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking Us to preserve
              data, in which case We would need to keep the data to comply with
              Our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as
              part of legal proceedings.
